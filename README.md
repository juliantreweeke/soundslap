# Soundslap.
## Slap your ear drums with epicness.
A community driven audio sample sharing website.
This is my first Ruby on Rails app.

## UPDATE
The last time I checked this site the MediaStreamRecorder plugin was not working.
This means that recording in the browser could be disabled.
I am currently looking into a different plugin to use for recording audio.

## Plugins used:

Wavesurfer.js

I used this plugin to create the wave forms from audio that is recorded or uploaded.

MediaStreamRecorder.js

I used this plugin to record audio in the browser.

## Bugs:

After searching for sounds, the speaker icon in the sound list does not play audio.

I ran out of time to put Terms of Use.

## Thanks

Big thanks to Luke Hammer and Edgey for helping me get this to work.
Also massive thanks to the people behind Wavesurfer.js and MediaStreamRecorder.

## Final Thoughts
Features I wanted to add but didn't have time
-Live Microphone volume graph.
-Let users comment on sounds.
-Terms of Use page added to Creative Commons information.
